# Scikit-Learn-End-to-End-Workflow
Created this project to take us from Zero to having a deep knowledge on sklearn and it's workflow for building ML models

**What we're going to cover**
- An end to end workflow
- Getting the data ready
- Choosing the right estimator/algorithm for our problems
- fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data
- Evaluate a model
- Improve a model
- Save and load a trained model
- Putting it all together
